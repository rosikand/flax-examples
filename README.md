# flax-examples
> Minimum viable examples of machine learning models in Jax + Flax.

The goal of this project is to produce minimum viable examples for common machine learning models in jax + flax. By minimum viable, we mean a very minimal implementation of the model just to show a working example. The data used in each model is a mini version of the fashion MNIST dataset. 

## Models 

- MLP image classifier: `mlp.ipynb`
- Autoencoder: `autoencoder.ipynb`
